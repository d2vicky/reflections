What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: logical commits saved
Cons: disaster when forget to save


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git focuses more on a collaborative whole to function properly whereas Google Docs is more a place to work on one file collaboratively.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Follow the commit message to check for each break down what logical changes have been made.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I'll not worry about introducing new bugs that may take hours to fix. I can just do it and see how my new idea goes and at the very least if something goes wrong I can switch back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Work on a big project.
