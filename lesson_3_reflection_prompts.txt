When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want other people to be able to get a copy of my work too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You don't want automatic pulling-remote change or even delete the codes you are working on locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
One probable senario is to know how you've been changing/adding compares to the point where you lastly up-to-date with the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Send a copy of the codes after each person's changes to next one. Make sure only one is editing at one time. But this is all-consuming compared to using GitHub.
